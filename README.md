# **Multivariate Analysis of Socioeconomic and Educational Factors Influencing Student Performance in Bangladesh: A Knowledge Discovery Approach**

---

## **Abstract**

This study investigates how socioeconomic and educational factors collectively influence student performance in Bangladesh secondary education using a data-driven approach grounded in the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) framework. A structured dataset from Kaggle was analyzed through data cleaning, transformation, and predictive modeling using Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Study time, academic track, attendance, extracurricular activities, and parental involvement emerged as significant predictors. Decision Trees achieved the best classification accuracy at 77.7%. The study offers actionable insights for policymakers to improve educational interventions and contributes to the growing field of educational data mining.

## **1. Introduction**

Understanding the multifactorial influences on student academic performance has become increasingly essential in the context of educational data mining. While innate cognitive ability plays a role, numerous studies highlight that external factors such as socioeconomic status (SES), parental education, school type, and access to learning resources significantly affect academic outcomes (Sirin, 2005; OECD, 2019; Romero & Ventura, 2010). These external factors are especially critical in developing countries like Bangladesh, where systemic inequalities further constrain educational opportunities.

This study employs multivariate statistical techniques and machine learning models to investigate how combinations of socioeconomic, demographic, and educational variables predict student performance outcomes in Bangladesh. The findings aim to contribute to evidence-based decision-making and educational policy interventions that address performance gaps at scale.

## **2. Literature Review**

Prior research has consistently identified SES, parental education, and school characteristics as dominant predictors of student achievement (Coleman et al., 1966; Hanushek & Woessmann, 2011). Educational data mining techniques such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and SVM have been widely used in learning analytics to reveal hidden patterns from educational datasets (Romero & Ventura, 2010; Baker & Siemens, 2014). Percentile-based categorization is frequently employed to stratify students into performance tiers (Siemens & Baker, 2012), improving class balance in classification tasks.

Preprocessing techniques like handling missing values (Little & Rubin, 2002), outlier detection (Aggarwal, 2015), and one-hot encoding (Han et al., 2012) have been recognized as critical for ensuring valid data mining outcomes. This study integrates these established practices into a unified KDD framework to ensure methodological rigor.

## **3. Methodology (Knowledge Discovery in Databases Framework)**

### 3.1 Data Source

* Kaggle dataset: Bangladesh Student Performance EDA (`bd_students_per.csv`).
* The dataset combines school records and self-reported surveys.

### 3.2 Variables of Interest

* **Dependent Variables (Performance Scores):** English, Math, Science, Social Science, Art & Culture.
* **Independent Variables:** Socioeconomic factors (parental education & employment, family size, location), educational inputs (studytime, attendance, tutoring, school type, internet access, extracurricular activities), and demographics.

---

### 3.3 Preprocessing

* Missing values in `location` imputed using mode ("Urban").
* Duplicate records: None found.
* Outliers handled via Interquartile Range (IQR). Subject score outliers retained to preserve real academic variations; age restricted to 13â€“20 years.
* Manual label cleaning: Consolidation of `Hons` into `Honors`, `None` into `Non_Educated`; standardized capitalization.
* No normalization applied due to tree-based model insensitivity to feature scaling.

---

### 3.4 Feature Engineering

* **Total Score:** Sum of all subject scores.
* **Performance Category:** Stratified into Low, Average, High via 20th and 80th percentiles to balance class distribution and improve model learning (Siemens & Baker, 2012).
* One-hot encoding applied to categorical features.

---

### 3.5 Modeling Approach

* Classification models:

  * Decision Tree (baseline model, interpretable).
  * Random Forest (ensemble learning).
  * Support Vector Machine (kernel-based classifier).
* Performance evaluated via accuracy and F1-score.

| Random Forest                | 77.6%     |
| Support Vector Machine (SVM) | 66.3%     |

**Interpretation:**
The Decision Tree model provided the highest accuracy while maintaining interpretability, justifying its selection as the primary model for policy analysis.

## **5. Discussion**

### 5.1 Alignment with Prior Research

Findings align strongly with prior literature emphasizing studytime, curriculum specialization, and parental involvement as primary drivers of academic success (Romero & Ventura, 2010; OECD, 2019; Sirin, 2005).

### 5.2 Educational Policy Implications

* **Academic Counseling:** Target interventions for time management and study habits.
* **Attendance Programs:** Enforce stricter attendance policies to reduce performance risks.
* **Curriculum Track Access:** Expand science curriculum accessibility.
* **Parent Engagement:** Encourage programs that promote parental involvement.

---

### 5.3 Limitations

* Dataset limited to one country and mostly self-reported data.
* Class imbalance reduced via percentile stratification but requires larger datasets for greater generalizability.
* Future models may incorporate neural networks or ensemble stacking for deeper pattern extraction.

## **6. Conclusion**

This study demonstrates how socioeconomic and educational variables jointly affect student performance in Bangladesh. Decision Trees, backed by Random Forest comparison, reveal actionable predictors that educational policymakers can address. The full KDD pipeline adopted ensures methodological transparency and reproducibility for future research.
