# **Multivariate Analysis of Socioeconomic and Educational Factors Influencing Student Performance in Bangladesh: Full KDD Process**

---

## **I. Introduction**

Understanding the multifactorial influences on student academic performance has become increasingly important in the context of data-driven educational research. While innate ability plays a role, numerous studies highlight the substantial impact of external factors such as socioeconomic status, parental education, school type, and access to learning resources on academic outcomes \[1], \[2]. These influences are particularly critical in developing countries, where systemic disparities often limit educational opportunities \[3].

This study presents a multivariate analysis of socioeconomic and educational factors influencing student performance in Bangladesh. Using a structured dataset containing variables such as parental occupation and education, family size, school type, internet access, study time, attendance, tutoring, and participation in extracurricular activities, we aim to identify the most significant predictors of academic success. Performance is measured through scores in core academic subjects‚ÄîEnglish, Mathematics, Science, Social Science‚Äîand Art & Culture.

The study adopts a data-driven approach, leveraging multivariate statistical techniques to uncover patterns and correlations that traditional univariate methods may overlook. This aligns with the growing emphasis on educational data mining and learning analytics in recent literature \[4], \[5]. The results are expected to provide insights that inform targeted interventions and support evidence-based policymaking in educational settings, especially in low- and middle-income countries.

## **II. Objectives**

The primary objective of this study is to examine how socioeconomic and educational factors collectively influence student performance in secondary education in Bangladesh. The research aims to explore the extent to which variables such as parental education and employment, family size, and geographic location (urban vs. rural) contribute to academic outcomes. In addition, the study investigates the impact of educational inputs, including school type, study time, internet access, tutoring, attendance, and extracurricular engagement on students' subject-specific performance across English, Mathematics, Science, Social Science, and Art & Culture.

To achieve these aims, the study employs multivariate statistical techniques to analyze the interactions between these variables and to identify the most significant predictors of student success. By leveraging a data-driven approach, the research seeks to provide empirical insights that can support evidence-based decision-making in educational policy and intervention strategies. Ultimately, the study contributes to the growing field of educational data analytics by demonstrating how multivariate analysis can be applied to real-world datasets to uncover patterns and inform educational development initiatives.
